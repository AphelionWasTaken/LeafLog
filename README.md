# LeafLog
LeafLog is a web-based plant growth journal for Android and Desktop. This app is written in Python with Flask and Kivy.

# How it works
When you run LeafLog, it will launch a Flask server at 127.0.0.1 (port 8080 on desktop, port 5000 on mobile). The app will then connect to the server through webview and load the UI.

From there, it's a basic journaling app. Open the side menu, add a plant, and get growing!
